Registration function: The user registration process should conform to the specified format to ensure the successful registration of the user, or return the corresponding error message in the event of an error.
Restaurant Search function: After the user has successfully registered, the restaurant search function should be able to function properly and return eligible results.
Exception handling: The system should be able to handle invalid mailbox, password does not meet the requirements, repeated registration and other errors, and can prompt the corresponding error message.
Data flow: The various modules of the system (registration, restaurant search, restaurant filtering) should be able to seamlessly integrate and handle both normal and abnormal data flows.
Set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines, GUIs, and static data sources.
